# ITS-genomic-pipeline
Author: postdoc ML Vermeire

Pipeline created for fungal DNA from the Soil Food Web project, funded by NRF, with PI as Heidi Hawkins. 
Subsequent analysis is included. 
Note that not all data files are included due to size. 

A bacteria 16S pipeline was also created as part of the project.
